# GroceryCounter
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  Will take input of groceries and count the amount and display them in a histogram style format. Uses python and C++ to do so.


What did you do particularly well?

  I really did well on using C++ to display the user information and process the function calls.
  
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I had trouble with dictionaries and tuple conversion as I don't think I did the best with them.
  
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  I had the most challenge with the data conversion, dictionaries and tuples as they were giving me a big problem.
  
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  Using code from one language to another. This is valuable information especially working with data stream, and moving that from one langauge to another.
  
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I used plenty of comments, to guide the user through every step of the way.
